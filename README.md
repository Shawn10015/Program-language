# Program-language
This language is an unique language for finance.
It can convert differnet currency into USD.
The format shoud be like this:

declare amount1 100.00USD
declare amount2 50.00EUR
declare amount3 7500.00JPY
declare amount4 20.00RMB
declare total amount1 + amount2 + amount3 + amount4
total

You can save the code as .txt and use python main.py fliename.txt to use it.
This code have four currency.
Due to Python has no data type specification, so there are errors when summing data of different formats.
The advantages of this language is that you can define a data type. In this code, I have formatted the data type to represent the different currencies.
You need to define your tpye first, then you won't make mistakes. It's more suitable for people to use. 
People do not need to use difficult programming languages, to learn difficult rules, to find bugs. Just write the currency and then see the result.
